# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. The goal of this analysis is to help prepare for the "silver tsunami" of current employees reaching retirement age.

## Results
* The silver tsunami will hit senior engingeering the hardest with more than 29,000 employees reaching retirement as seen in this [breakdown]https://github.com/LaurenSonis/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/2021-01-24%20(4).png.
* Meanwhile, management will not suffer much with only two employees reaching retirement age.
